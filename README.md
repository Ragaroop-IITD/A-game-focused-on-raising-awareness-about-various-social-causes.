Pygame

This game was made using Python using the Python library called pygame.
Inbuilt features of pygame, like Vectors, are quite useful, and we used them extensively in designing our game.
We created a map using software called Tiled. This software offers us a way to create our map using different tilesets and objects.  
Our map was designed with 128x128 32px tiles.  
We also initialized coordinates for the sprite that appears in the top-left corner of the window and helps the player navigate.
You need to install some Python libraries that were given in the requirements.txt
We used Hugging Face API, namely Hugging Chat, instead of CHAT GPT API, which offers free AI-generated outputs and it can also access the web.
To run the game you need to install all the libraries in requirements.txt and open terminal with code folder as the root directory and run the command shown below.
`python3 main.py`
